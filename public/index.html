        <h3> First Day</h3>

        <p>On Saturday 27th of May we started our journey to Brecon Becon. It was a sunny, warm day and we were happy that Monday
            was a bank holiday. We wanted to go camping there.</p>

        <p>Before, I say anything I should let you know how we started our journey. This is the first time that we go camping
            alone as a result we didn't have so many equipments. We decided to go to Decathlone and Coswold to buy some stuff.
            We only had a tent and two sleeping bag from our revious camping with our friends. We bought everything
            <ul>
                <li>kettle</li>
                <li>pans</li>
                <li> inflatable mattressv( because the other time the ground was so uncomfortable)</li>
                <li> gas and its stuff</li>
                <li> a flask</li>
                <li> some food and water</li>
            </ul>



        </p>

        <p> We also needed to buy hiking shoes. When we went to Coswold the guy who helped us to choose and fit the boots was
            shocked that we are going today. You should see his face! He asked us several time that do you really wanna go
            today or not!

        </p>
        <p> Any way at 1:00 pm we were ready to start our journey.</p>
        <p> The weather forcast predicting that it would be heavey rain from Sunday and it makes us somehow worried and disappointed.
            but we were ditermined to go camping. we just search Brecon Becon on our phones and start Driving. It took 4
            hours to get there and there was a toll that you have to pay to enter Wales. Wales is a beauty. everything is
            written in Welsh and English and I wonder how their alphabets are. I think it took 1 hour to realised that we
            are in Brecon Becon. We went through very narrow ways. Some of them as wide as a small car. After we realised
            that we arrived we decided to fing a place to eat something as we were very hungry and it was almost 6 pm. awe
            found a local pub with horrible food! We ate that disgusting food and started to find a place to camp.</p>

        <p> We thought that we could find a camp site very easily but we were wrong. All camp sites were full or booked and we
            couldn't believe how we
            <b>forgot</b> to book a place. Anyway, in one of these camp sites a lovely lady gave us the address of a farm that
            always have a place for camping. we were so happy! An important point here is that your phone is not working
            in many remote areas and you have to learn to follow the signes and the explanation written for you to find your
            way.
